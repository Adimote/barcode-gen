# Barcode Generator

Generates inventory barcodes for sticking on kits.

either run the script directly by passing in the codes as a parameter:

` python3 barcode-gen.py 00-00-00-00 00-00-00-01 `

or by putting into the `kit-codes`, 'kit-codes-short', or 'team-codes' file (one line per code) and calling `make`
